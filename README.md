<p>Disaster management in India refers to conservation of lives and property during a natural and man-made disaster. Disaster management plans are multi-layered and are planned to address issues such as floods, hurricanes, fires, mass failure of utilities and the rapid spread of disease. India is especially vulnerable to natural disasters because of its unique geo-climatic conditions, having recurrent floods, droughts, cyclones, earthquakes, and landslides. As India is a very large country, different regions are vulnerable to different natural disasters. For example, during rainy season the peninsular regions of South India is mostly affected by cyclones and states of West India experience severe drought during summer. </p>
